# linear_regression_live
This code is a modification of the "How to Do Linear Regression the Right Way" live session by Siraj Raval on Youtube


##Overview

Thanks a lot Siraj Raval :D

Original code was for [this](https://youtu.be/uwwWVAgJBcM) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval.

Siraj Raval: I'm using a small dataset of student test scores and the amount of hours they studied. Intuitively, there must be a relationship right? The more you study, the better your test scores should be. We're going to use [linear regression](https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat501/node/250) to prove this relationship. 


Me: Added functions to visualize Linear Regression by Steps, graphs are generated

Here are some helpful links:

####Sum of squared distances formula (to calculate our error)

####Partial derivative with respect to b and m (to perform gradient descent)

##Dependencies

* numpy

Python 2 and 3 both work for this. Use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install any dependencies.

If you use Anaconda added an enviorment 'enviorment_siraj-regression.yaml'

##Usage

Just run ``demo.py`` to see the results.

``python demo.py`` on terminal.
